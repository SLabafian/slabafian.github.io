 2024:

- I finished my second full marathon in London, fulfilling my dream, but I was in pain for two months and injured my right ankle!
- I got rejected from Oxford University's internship scholarship for ethical AI. 
- I wanted to hike for a week in Brighton this summer, but I missed it because my dissertation needed more time.

  

 2023:
  - I couldn’t find a room to rent in London, so I had to stay in a hostel for two weeks, spending £700 per week. However, I found/met my dear friend there, and now I live in a great home and neighborhood.
  - I had such high hopes for the Chevening Scholarship and I got rejected. However, I received a full tuition fee research scholarship!
  - I missed the deadline to apply to Amsterdam University.
  - I received an offer from ENS Paris University, but they didn’t offer me a scholarship.


  

 2022:
- Our startup failed in Tehran, but I decided to learn more about management and business analytics, which gave me invaluable knowledge and skills.
