I just graduated with a master’s degree from the University of London, SOAS, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Prof. Adib-Moghadam](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=professor+arshin+adib-moghaddam) at the [Centre of Future AI](https://www.soas.ac.uk/research/research-centres/centre-ai-futures).

I specialize in applying ethnographic and user-centered approaches to the design of emerging technologies, with a particular focus on assistive IoT devices and large language model–based agents. By carefully examining both designers’ and users’ values, I aim to uncover the complex dynamics that shape interactions with technology and to identify potential sources of bias. My research draws on principles from social identity theory in human-computer interaction to understand how individual and group identities influence user experiences, decision-making, and engagement with digital systems. Through this lens, I strive to develop design strategies that are both inclusive and ethically grounded, ensuring that technological innovation aligns with the diverse needs and values of the communities it serves. My work integrates theoretical insight with practical application, addressing real-world challenges while advancing knowledge of how sociocultural factors intersect with technology use. Here is [my CV](/files/CVFile.pdf).
