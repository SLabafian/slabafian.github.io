I recently graduated with a master’s degree from the University of London, SOAS, where I had the privilege of working under the guidance of [Prof. Adib-Moghadam](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=arshin+adob+moghadam) at the [Centre of Future AI](https://www.soas.ac.uk/research/research-centres/centre-ai-futures).

My passion lies in exploring mental models and behaviours in human-computer interaction, with a particular focus on security and privacy concerns surrounding IoT and AI systems. I’m deeply interested in assessing the ethical integrity of these technologies to ensure their safety and responsible use. Additionally, I enjoy designing real-world solutions that bridge the gap between technical challenges and end-user concerns. Recently, I’ve been delving into the security and privacy implications of using GPTs within IoT devices—a rapidly evolving area that I find both fascinating and impactful.
